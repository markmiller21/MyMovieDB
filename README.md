# MyMovieDB
React Native Project that leverages the movie database API to display some of the best rated new movies

This project was created as an example project for a talk on React Native that I gave at Solution in June of 2016.  The application will retrieve some of the most popular movies from "the movie database" API.  Each movie will be displayed in a ListView on the homescreen.  This listview contains the name of the movie, when the movie was released, and the movie's poster.

Each movie is clickable and will launch a new view where it displays a more in depth synopsis of the movie.  This screen will dispaly the poster image, a backdrop image, the title of the movie, and a full overview of the movie.

I used React version 15.0.2, react-native version 0.26.3, and react-native-simple-router version 0.9.2
